# RFID-Cloner
This RFID Cloner uses an Arduino Nano to read and duplicate RFID tags. By connecting an RFID reader module (e.g., MFRC522) via SPI, it allows users to easily clone tags for applications like access control or security systems. The project is simple to set up and ideal for learning and experimentation with RFID technology.
